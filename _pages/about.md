I am 28 years old, living in Geneva, working at CERN. I'm originally from
Scotland, having grown up in the town of Hawick in the Scottish Borders, and
studied at the University of Glasgow where I currently study for a PhD.

I am interested in understanding the world, through data, through scientific
discovery, through simulation. My interests are extremely broad. I have analysed
the behaviour of flapping wings and designed hypersonic vehicles as part of my
aerospace undergraduate degree. I have studied the structure of the Standard
Model and of new theories of particle physics. I research the behaviour of the heaviest fundamental particle
and test properties of quantum physics experiments. 

I enjoy differential geometry, reading fiction, playing the piano, sweating it
out on the tennis court, hiking through the Swiss Alps, skiing through the
French Alps, and trying to find a good place in Geneva for a beer.
