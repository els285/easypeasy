I am 28 years old, living in Geneva, working at CERN. I'm originally from
Scotland, having grown up in the town of Hawick in the Scottish Borders, and
studied at the University of Glasgow where I currently study for a PhD.

I am interested in understanding the world, through data, through scientific
discovery, through simulation. My interests are extremely broad. I have analysed
the behaviour of flapping wings and designed hypersonic vehicles as part of my
aerospace undergraduate degree. I have studied the structure of the Standard
Model and of new theories of particle physics. I research the behaviour of the
heaviest fundamental particle and test its properties in quantum physics
experiments. 

Other interests include reading fiction, playing the piano, ifferential
geometry, sweating it out on the tennis court, hiking through the Swiss Alps,
skiing through the French Alps, cooking, and trying to find a good place in Geneva for a
beer.

<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>

<p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>

<div>This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border.
