## Python Development

In my spare time, I like to develop Python packages, to help develop my advanced
Python skills and to apply data science diagnostics and visualisation to
data-problems applicable to my everyday life.

In a finance context, I have developed `starlingpy` and `costsplit`.
I use `starlingpy` to track my finances, categorise transactions and visualise
expenditure in an interactive web-app. `costsplit` is a shameless rip-off
(though all original code) of those apps designed to simplify repayments between
members of large groups.

In a HEP context, I use my `heptools` package day-to-day to explore ROOT data
and visualise histograms. The `hepdash` package is a web-based interactive tools
for histogram visualisation, built around the `streamlit` package. 

## Aerospace

Harking back to my undergraduate days, I have developed `AeroJulia`, a
Julia-lang package which contains many aerodynamic and thermodynamic tools for
solving problems in compressible fluid mechanics (sometimes called gas dynamics)
contexts. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/els285/AeroJulia)
