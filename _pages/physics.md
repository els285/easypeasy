<!-- # Physics  -->

I work with the ATLAS Collaboration in CERN, Geneva, on several different areas
of high-energy particle physics.

## Properties of the Top Quark
The top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle. This fact alone means that
the top quark is extremely interesting to study. It provides us with a test for
the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and allows us to investigate
avenues of New Physics (i.e. physics not in the Standard Model.)

I am interested in properties of the top quark, particularly how it spins. We
have studied top quark spin correlations and polarisations using the ATLAS Run-2
dataset in several top production mechanisms.

## Quantum Information in Collider Physics
I am interested in the intersection between collider physics and quantum
information. We are looking to make measure quantum phenomena such as
entanglement in top quark and W boson qubit and qutrit states, the first of such
measurements ever undertaken in a high-energy physics context!

## Setting Limits on New Physics 
The effective field theory (EFT) framework is an extremely popular means of
constraining where new physics may be. I am interested in applying the EFT
methodology to new measurements in the top quark sector.

## Machine Learning for Fast Simulation
Simulation of the interaction between particles and the ATLAS detector is
incredibly CPU-intensive. This work looks at applying DNN and GNN regression
techniques to write emulate the detector response in an expeditious way.
