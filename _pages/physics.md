<!-- # Physics  -->

I work with the ATLAS Collaboration in CERN, Geneva, on several different areas
of high-energy particle physics.

## Properties of the Top Quark
The top quark is the heaviest fundamental particle. This fact alone means that
the top quark is extremely interesting to study. It provides us with a test for
the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and allows us to investigate
avenues of New Physics (i.e. physics not in the Standard Model.)

I am interested in properties of the top quark, particularly how it spins when
combined with its antiparticle, and with scalar and vector bosons. Formally, we
have studied top quark spin correlations and polarisation using the ATLAS Run-2
dataset in $$ t \bar{t} $$ and $$ t \bar{t} Z $$, and would like to extent to
further associated production systems.
